# Introduction Machine Learning for neuroimaging with nilearn and scikit-learn
## Resources @ MAIN 2021

These two tutorials will introduce you to the [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html) library to manipulate and process fMRI data, and to [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to apply machine learning techniques on your data.

### Pre-requisites

You need to have access to a terminal with Python 3. If it not already the case, [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-check-your-python-version-on-windows) is a guide to install
python 3 on any OS.

## Setup

We encourage you to use a virtual environment for this tutorial (and for all your projects, that's a good practice). To do this, run the following command in your terminal, it will create the
environment in a folder names `env_tuto`:
```
python3 -m venv env_tuto
```
Then the following command will activate the environment :
```
source env_tuto/bin/activate
```
Finally, you can install the required libraries :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Now that you are all set, you can run the notebooks with the command :
```
jupyter notebook
```
