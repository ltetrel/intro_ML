abstract = "Functional connectomes reveal biomarkers of individual
psychological or clinical traits. However, there is great
variability in the analytic pipelines typically used to derive
them from rest-fMRI cohorts. Here, we consider a specific type of
studies, using predictive models on the edge weights of
functional connectomes, for which we highlight the best modeling
choices. We systematically study the prediction performances of
models in 6 different cohorts and a total of 2000 individuals,
encompassing neuro-degenerative (Alzheimer's, Post-traumatic
stress disorder), neuro-psychiatric (Schizophrenia, Autism), drug
impact (Cannabis use) clinical settings and psychological trait
(fluid intelligence). The typical prediction procedure from
rest-fMRI consists of three main steps: defining brain regions,
representing the interactions, and supervised learning. For each
step we benchmark typical choices: 8 different ways of defining
regions -either pre-defined or generated from the rest-fMRI data-
3 measures to build functional connectomes from the extracted
time-series, and 10 classification models to compare functional
interactions across subjects. Our benchmarks summarize more than
240 different pipelines and outline modeling choices that show
consistent prediction performances in spite of variations in the
populations and sites. We find that regions defined from
functional data work best; that it is beneficial to capture
between-region interactions with tangent-based parametrization of
covariances, a midway between correlations and partial
correlation; and that simple linear predictors such as a logistic
regression give the best predictions. Our work is a step forward
to establishing reproducible imaging-based biomarkers for
clinical settings.",

  abstract = "The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor
              and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger
              tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated
              trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s
              and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to
              be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be
              predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular
              function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response
              varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this
              character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon
              model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to
              concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different
              temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the
              measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the
              individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was
              found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual
              rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the
              response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is
              effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The
              deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a
              short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may
              be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal
              blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating
              responses in eventrelated fMRI.",

        activity patterns that does not require an experimental design
        to be specified. We estimate this model in the dictionary
        learning framework, learning simultaneously latent spatial maps
        and the corresponding brain activity time-series. Unlike
        previous dictionary learning frameworks, we introduce an
        explicit difference between subject-level spatial maps and their
        corresponding population-level maps, forming an atlas. We give a
        novel algorithm using convex optimization techniques to solve
        efficiently this problem with non-smooth penalties well-suited
        to image denoising. We show on simulated data that it can
        recover population-level maps as well as subject specificities.
        On resting-state fMRI data, we extract the first atlas of
        spontaneous brain activity and show how it defines a
        subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain in
